It's not Immovable Object but it will suffice. Impulse Amplifier will still be best in slot for offering near instant projectiles. Slice for Sever is also great in any team environment. The funniest build for me is the full block fast movement (fast as f*ck boi) with Tilting at Windmills and the new Melee Momentum perk providing a total of 14 seconds of improved movement speed (it's also possible it stacks for 4 seconds of super fast speed).\nMasterworks: Range, Shield Duration"
