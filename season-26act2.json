            "description": "First-choice PvE pick for clearing groups of Minor adds in both general at-level or better or end-game underleveled content, particularly with Void builds. Unfortunately, Anamnesis is in the Lightweight subfamily of bows, so although you do get the frame intrinsic +20 Mobility and \u00d71.0625 movement speed bonus, that's at the cost of accuracy and damage. At base, the stats are in-band - 32 Accuracy, 50 Stability is \u00d71.1844 flinch resist at 100 Resilience and a perfect draw window of 0.65s, 64 Handling is 0.55s ready, 0.41s ADS and 0.42s stow speed, 60 Reload Speed is a 0.68s reload, and Recoil Direction is 40. As ever with bows, the usual play is to reduce Draw Time with the bowstring perk and recover any lost accuracy with the arrow perk. For void builds, there are the trait perk combinations of Repulsor Break, for a void overshield on a void-debuffed kill in the first column, together with either Destabilizing Rounds, to spread AoE volatility and proc volatile rounds for 4.5s on kills, or Demoralize to spread AoE weaken for an effective \u00d71.18 damage boost against enemies. If you're interested, \"Anamnesis\" is the act of recalling something to mind. Willing Vessel is a useful, if unspectacular origin trait to boost gunfeel stats in the background as you hit and kill targets, but if you're in a fireteam, and manually reloading, Runneth Over will overfill your magazine by an additional 10% (rounded up) for each Guardian you're within 15m of. Recommended MW: Draw Time, with a Quick Access Sling mod or, when masterworked, Synergy to create Void Breaches or, when the artifact mod's around, Stunloader. Also, don't forget to check whether there's a useful Seasonal Fragile mod for the activity you're running."

Division is a heavy burst, so is in one of the better sidearm subfamilies for damage output, as well as improving resistance to flinch. At base, the stats are okay - 50 Range and 12 Zoom equate to 15.60m ADS and 13.00m hipfire, 39 Stability is \u00d71.1427 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 33 Handling is 0.34s ready, 0.27s ADS and 0.36s stow speed, 24 Reload Speed is a 1.86s reload, Recoil Direction is 97 and magazine is 24 (max 40). On Controller, a little help with controlling recoil is useful, or on M+KB boost handling with the barrel perk, and look for reload speed with the magazine perk. For arc builds, and if you never got the chance to craft a Brigand's Law, the trait perk combination of Eddy Current in the first column can just about max out Reload Speed when you're Amplified, with a \u00d70.95 animation scalar, which is ideal to use with Voltshot in the second to apply Jolt to targets for chunk damage and AoE arc damage for add clearing. Willing Vessel is a useful, if unspectacular origin trait to boost gunfeel stats in the background as you hit and kill targets, but if you're in a fireteam, and manually reloading, Runneth Over will overfill your magazine by an additional 10% (rounded up) for each Guardian you're within 15m of.

Division is a heavy burst, so is in one of the better sidearm subfamilies for damage output, as well as improving resistance to flinch. At base, the stats are okay - 50 Range and 12 Zoom equate to 15.60m ADS and 13.00m hipfire, 39 Stability is \u00d71.1427 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 33 Handling is 0.34s ready, 0.27s ADS and 0.36s stow speed, 24 Reload Speed is a 1.86s reload, Recoil Direction is 97 and magazine is 24 (max 40). On Controller, a little help with controlling recoil is useful, or on M+KB boost handling with the barrel perk, and look for reload speed with the magazine perk. For arc builds, and if you never got the chance to craft a Brigand's Law, the trait perk combination of Eddy Current in the first column can just about max out Reload Speed when you're Amplified, with a \u00d70.95 animation scalar, which is ideal to use with Voltshot in the second to apply Jolt to targets for chunk damage and AoE arc damage for add clearing. Willing Vessel is a useful, if unspectacular origin trait to boost gunfeel stats in the background as you hit and kill targets, but if you're in a fireteam, and manually reloading, Runneth Over will overfill your magazine by an additional 10% (rounded up) for each Guardian you're within 15m of. Recommended MW: Reload Speed, Handling or Stability, with a Backup Mag mod or, when masterworked, Synergy to create Ionic Traces or, when the artifact mod's around, Stunloader. Also, don't forget to check whether there's a useful Seasonal Fragile mod for the activity you're running."

            "description": "First-choice PvE pick for use against Minor adds in general at-level or better content, particularly with melee builds. If you don't already have a well-rolled melee build SMG or are looking for a replacement for an older one without an origin trait, then Mirror Imago could work but, if you do, you can safely give it a pass. At base, the stats are okay - 42 Range and 14 Zoom equates to 18.24m ADS and 13.03m hipfire, 46 Stability is \u00d71.1731 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 52 Handling is 0.35s ready, 0.26s ADS and 0.32s stow speed, 50 Reload Speed is a 1.82s reload, Recoil Direction is 99 and magazine size is 36 (max 41). Use the barrel perk for Handling on M+KB or Stability for controller, although you might also find a little extra range useful, and the magazine perk can be used to provide a bit more reload speed or extra rounds. For melee builds, there are a few options in the first trait perk column, Pugilist is the obvious one, returning melee ability energy on kills, but Grave Robber is useful for an instant refill of your magazine with a melee kill or a hit with an elemental melee, or Recycled Energy (when it's a bit less buggy) will probably be useful for gaining ability energy to your lowest charged ability when reloading after a kill.
